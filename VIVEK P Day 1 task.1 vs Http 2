Http 1.1 vs Http 2
HTTP 1.1:
HTTP is known as Hypertext transfer protocol which is used to tranfer neccessary  informations for client from the web using some protocol.it acts as a pipelining
to connect client and server using IP address,MAC address and port number.
The port number starts from the range of 80 to 60000.
http 1 loads single request for every TCP connection.in http1.1 the tcp connection can be reusable so that multiple responses and requests can be done by pipelining 
so that client can search for various resourses from the same server at the same time but for each and every search only one request and response only possible in http1.1
Http 1.1 gives status codes like 1xx,2xx,3xx,4xx,5xx.
HTTP2:
Http 2 is much faster and reliable than http1.1.This protocol uses multiplexing where the initiating tcp connection is comparatively very fast.In http2 muliple responses
can be attained by single request.Http2 also have server push method so that it can give relevant search results even there is no such requests given.It uses caches and 
if the client searched resourses is found means it can cancel the pushed request with the help of this server push method.Status codes for http2 are same like http1.1
Http loads web page very quick and it reduces network traffic.
